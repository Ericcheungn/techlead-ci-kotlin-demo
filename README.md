# Tech Lead Prototype – Sprint 1 Delivery

This repository simulates the delivery of an end-to-end prototype under a Tech Lead role, including team organization, requirement alignment, sprint reporting, CI/CD setup, and full-stack implementation.

Tech Lead Overview

As the acting Tech Lead, I organized a simulated team of 5–7 roles (see `docs/team-roles.md`) and led a 10-day Sprint to deliver a functional product prototype. This involved:

- Sprint planning and team role coordination
- CI/CD pipeline setup using GitHub Actions
- End-to-end implementation: Android frontend (Jetpack Compose) + Spring Boot backend
- Communication via GitHub Issues & Kanban board
- Weekly stakeholder status reporting (`docs/Sprint1_Stakeholder_Status_Report.pdf`)
- Architecture documentation and risk tracking
